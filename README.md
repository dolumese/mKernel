# mKernel: Basic Kernel with a Command Line Interface
This is a simple kernel/OS that was built to include keyboard input and display
characters to the screen. It is set up a command line where the user can run
various included commands.

The core kernel design, assembly and linking level, was based of Arjun Sreedharan's
tutorials [Kernel 101 - Let's write a Kernel](http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel)
and [Kernel 201 - Letâ€™s write a Kernel with keyboard and screen support](http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/99370248137/kernel-201-lets-write-a-kernel-with-keyboard).

## Motivation
This is a project built as a learning experience and as part of a do-your-own-project
college computer science course.

## Usage
